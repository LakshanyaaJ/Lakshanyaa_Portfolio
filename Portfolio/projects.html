    <h2>A MACHINE LEARNING–ENABLED DIGITAL TWIN OF AN EHV SUBSTATION</h2>
    <p>
     Built a scalable frontend interface using React/Next.js to represent 3D digital twin models of substation components
and operational workflows.
Optimized UI performance and state management for real-time data updates and system simulations.
Ensured cross-browser compatibility and responsive design, improving usability across different devices
